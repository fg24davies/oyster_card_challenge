# Oyster Card Challenge 

Week 2 of Maker's afternoon challenges, it started with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes (reinforcing what we learned last week). Thn we were challenged to build a more complex system which stretched our skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

The functionality of the Oyster card was determined from the given user stories

```
In order to use public transport
As a customer
I want money on my card

In order to keep using public transport
As a customer
I want to add money to my card

In order to protect my money
As a customer
I don't want to put too much money on my card

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need my fare deducted from my card

In order to get through the barriers
As a customer
I need to touch in and out

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to have the minimum amount for a single journey

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to pay for my journey when it's complete

In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need to know where I've travelled from

In order to know where I have been
As a customer
I want to see to all my previous trips

In order to know how far I have travelled
As a customer
I want to know what zone a station is in

In order to be charged correctly
As a customer
I need a penalty charge deducted if I fail to touch in or out

In order to be charged the correct amount
As a customer
I need to have the correct fare calculated
```

## Motivation

This project was part of resources working towards the learning objectives of week 2:

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)

Currently all challenges are complete but there is an error when calling the fare method to come back to.

Testing the code in IRB shows this error:

The code is written in Ruby and using RSpec tests.

Big shout out to @Emmapr123, @Yates101, @IchchadhariNaag, @TataSher, @LizTruman for the pair programming sesssions to work on this project together.
